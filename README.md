This project involves data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis using SQL. The task is to design tables for data from six CSV files, import the data into a SQL database, join data, and answer questions about the data. The data pertains to employees from the 1980s and 1990s at a fictional company, Pewlett Hackard.

## Instructions

1. **Data Modeling**: Inspect the CSV files and sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables.
2. **Data Engineering**: Create a table schema for each CSV file, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
3. **Data Analysis**: Answer various questions about the data, such as listing the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

What you can do with this project:
- Set up your own SQL database and import your own csv data.
- Write SQL queries to answer data analysis questions.

Questions you can answer:
    1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
    2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
    3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
    4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
    6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
    7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
    8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
